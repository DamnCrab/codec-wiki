# DSV

DSV or DSV1 (Digital Subband Video 1) is a compact, software-only video codec focusing on simplicity and wavelet-based compression, with features rivaling early MPEG standards. The reference implementation of the codec is designed for flexibility and ease of use in C environments. As of October 2024, DSV1 has been superseded by [DSV2](./DSV2.mdx).

## Features

- **Wavelet-based compression:** Uses multiresolution subband analysis (wavelet transform) instead of DCT. More information on wavelet transforms is available on the [DSV2](./DSV2.mdx) page.
- **Motion Compensation:** Supports half-pixel motion compensation.
- **Chroma Subsampling:** 4:1:1, 4:2:0, 4:2:2, and 4:4:4 formats.
- **Adaptive Quantization:** Dynamically adjusts quantization for better quality.
- **Frame Types:** Supports intra and inter frames with variable-length closed GOPs (no bidirectional/B-frames, only forward prediction).
- **Entropy Coding:** Uses interleaved exponential-Golomb coding for simplicity.
- **Compression Range:** Supports a wider range of compression and lower bitrates than MPEG-1/2.

The reference DSV encoder features:

- **Rate Control:** Single-pass average bitrate (ABR) or constant rate factor (CRF).
- **Human Visual System (HVS) Optimization:** Simple intra block mode determination.
- **Scene Change Detection:** Based on average luma changes.
- **Hierarchical Motion Estimation:** For improved efficiency.
- **Adaptive Quantization Stability Tracking:** Improves quality.
- **C89 Compatibility:** Written for standard C89, no external libraries, integer-only arithmetic, single-threaded, and portable.

## Limitations

- No built-in interlacing support.
- Only 8 bits per component supported.
- Frame dimensions must be divisible by 2.

### Example Usage

The only DSV encoder available is the reference encoder.

- Encoding:
  ```
  ./dsv1 e -y -v -inp_bus_cif.yuv -out_saved.dsv -gop12 -w352 -h288 -fps_num30 -qp85 -kbps1100
  ```
- Decoding:
  ```
  ./dsv1 d -inp_video.dsv -out_decompressed.yuv -out420p
  ```

### Documentation & More

Detailed information is available in [the repository](https://github.com/LMP88959/Digital-Subband-Video-1)â€™s PDF documents (`DSV1_spec.pdf`, `DSV1_encoder.pdf`). More example videos and usage instructions are provided in the README and linked resources in the repo.
