# Eve-AV1

Eve-AV1 is a proprietary [AV1](../video/AV1.mdx) video encoder developed by Two Orioles, LLC, an organization primarily known for their work on [dav1d](../utilities/dav1d.mdx), the most widely used AV1 software decoder.

According to the Two Orioles [webpage on Eve-AV1](https://www.twoorioles.com/eve-av1):

> Eve-AV1 gives you an unprecedented level of video quality for streaming on-demand video. It provides a 20% reduction in bitrate at the same visual quality compared to other AV1 encoders. Or you can choose a 3 to 5 times speedup in encoding time

A single visual comparison is provided, alongside BD-rate graphs for [VMAF](../metrics/VMAF.mdx).

## Performance

Eve-AV1 appears to perform quite well according to VMAF, and is able to do so at what appear to be impressive speeds. However, without more detailed visual comparisons, it is hard to take this data at face value.
