# Eve-AV1

Eve-AV1 is a proprietary [AV1](../video/AV1.mdx) video encoder developed by Two Orioles, LLC, an organization primarily known for their work on [dav1d](../utilities/dav1d.mdx), the most widely used AV1 software decoder.

According to the Two Orioles [webpage on Eve-AV1](https://www.twoorioles.com/eve-av1):

> Eve-AV1 gives you an unprecedented level of video quality for streaming on-demand video. It provides a 20% reduction in bitrate at the same visual quality compared to other AV1 encoders. Or you can choose a 3 to 5 times speedup in encoding time

A single visual comparison is provided, alongside dated numbers. Not much else is known about Eve-AV1 at this time.
