# Eve-VP9

Eve-VP9 is a proprietary [VP9](../video/VP9.mdx) video encoder developed by Two Orioles, LLC, an organization primarily known for their work on [dav1d](../utilities/dav1d.mdx), the most widely used AV1 software decoder.

According to the Two Orioles [webpage on Eve-VP9](https://www.twoorioles.com/eve-vp9):

> At top quality, EVE-VP9 provides nearly 20% better compression than libvpx at the same speed; 10% better compression than x265 at 50% faster speed; and compared to x264, EVE-VP9 is nearly 40% better.

Sparse visual comparisons and BD-rate graphs for VMAF are provided by the company, but no further details are available.

## Performance

Eve-VP9 appears to perform quite well according to VMAF, and is able to do so at what appear to be impressive speeds. However, without more detailed visual comparisons, it is hard to take this data at face value.
