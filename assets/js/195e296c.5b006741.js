This transformation converts the pixel values into a set of frequency components, taking spatial data and transforming it to the frequency domain. The DCT is applied to each color channel in the YCbCr color space. This algorithm is a particularly good choice for image (and music/speech) compression because it has high energy compaction relative to our understanding of images & their perceptual quality.
