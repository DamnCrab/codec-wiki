All Arch Linux packages are compressed at zstd level 20, allowing Arch packages to be decompressed 14 times faster compared to XZ at the cost of an average 0.8% filesize increase across all packages. It is popular in the game emulation scene as well, as many game file formats for emulating console games support zstd compression.
